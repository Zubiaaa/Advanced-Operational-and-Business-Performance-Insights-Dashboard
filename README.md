# Business Case: Data visualization for operational business use

XYZ business collates and sells airport taxi services to customers through ‘partners’ who deliver the experience. Because they work with partners, they need to be sure they can track and manage the quality of the service they’re delivering so the Partner Services team can approach any performance issues quickly and efficiently.

In this task, you should take a set of business data coming from XYZ’s backend and visualize it using Power BI. Your report should enable the partner services team to identify poor performing partners and the scale of their performance. This team is familiar with using the visualization tool, but isn’t always as data savvy as you or your team, so make sure any of your recommendations are clear.

The dataset consists of a fact table (fact transactions) and a few optional dim tables to add extra info if needed. The transactions table is 1 row per transaction, ‘pickUpDate’ refers to the date the experience took place, whilst ‘surveyCompleteDate’ refers to the date the customer completed the post journey survey for their experience. The ‘surveyScore’ field refers to the score given by a customer after their experience took place, with 5 being the highest, and 1 the lowest. ‘hasIncident’ refers to any customer service complaints the customer has raised about their experience.
